/* 
WOO CUSTOM STYLESHEET
---------------------

Instructions:

Add your custom styles in this file instead of style.css so it 
is easier to update the theme. Simply copy an existing style 
from style.css to this file, and modify it to your liking. */

/* The stupid "basket" which looks like a middle finger needs to be removed from the real css file?

put that here and remove after any updates */

/* change background texture? */
